          Allow me to introduce Norma and Jose, the passionate owners of Viva
          Jalisco, a typical Mexican restaurant located in Bothell, Washington.
          Hailing from Tototlán, Jalisco, they bring with them the rich cultural
          heritage of this enchanting region, known as the cradle of Mexican
          culture. <br />  <br />
          Jalisco, the birthplace of tequila, mariachi music, and
          charrerias, has a deep-rooted tradition of celebrating life and
          embracing its unique flavors. Norma and Joses journey from Tototlán
          to Bothell is a testament to their love for sharing the authentic
          taste of their homeland with the local community.
